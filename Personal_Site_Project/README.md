# Personal Site Project 
This project is a personal website I developed to showcase the integration between my personal hobbies and the stage of web design I was in at the time. The design features three different responsive sizes and takes a user-centered approach to each layout. Combining interaction efficiency with an aesthetic look, this website includes a landing page and a projects page. The hover and selection effects provide an engaging user experience without interfering with the core functionality of the site. It is optimized for phone, tablet, and desktop viewing.
